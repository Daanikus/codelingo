        title: Do Not Discard Errors
        body: |
          Do not discard errors using _ variables. If a function returns an error, 
          check it to make sure the function succeeded. Handle the error, return it, or, 
          in truly exceptional situations, panic.

          Do not discard errors using _ variables. If ignoring the error is intentional, add a justification in a comment.
